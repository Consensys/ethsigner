# EthSigner
A transaction signing application to be used with a web3 provider. All questions, queries and other discussion can be found on [Discord].

## ⚠️ Project Deprecation ⚠️
As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver the best remote signing solutions, we are announcing a change in our product offerings.

We have decided to deprecate our EthSigner product to focus our efforts on enhancing [Web3Signer](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer), our newly comprehensive remote signing solution. This is rooted in our strategy to streamline our offerings and focus on a single, robust product that will provide functionality for both transaction and Ethereum validator signing. We hope this makes it applicable to all your use-cases like public Ethereum signing, staking infrastructure offerings, and in private network contexts.

Rest assured, we are not dropping existing EthSigner functionality. We are updating Web3Signer to incorporate the functionalities of EthSigner alongside everything else in Web3Signer. We will ensure a smooth transition by maintaining EthSigner with necessary patches until 31st December. We hope this provides ample time for any necessary migration to Web3Signer.
